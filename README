# Its Elliot's Birthday!
### Website created for my buddy Elliot's 24th birthday.

I threw it together in 2 days totalling about 5 hours of work. Meant as a psuedo-birthday present for my friend Elliot.
A bunch of hacky javascript glues the entire thing together. Going for that geocities aesthetic.
